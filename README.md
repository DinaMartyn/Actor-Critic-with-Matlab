# Actor-Critic-with-Matlab
Implementation of Actorâ€“Critic Method with Matlab to inverted pendulum

## Project Details
	
The README describes the the project environment details (i.e., the state and action spaces, and when the environment is considered solved).

## Getting Started
	
The README has instructions for installing dependencies or downloading needed files.

## Instructions

The README describes how to run the code in the repository, to train the agent. For additional resources on creating READMEs or using Markdown, see here and here.

## Future plans

0. Understand Actor-Critic method
1. Implement Actor-Critic with Python on the inv. pendulum env
2. Implement Actor-Critic in Matlab
